HSAs are single- or multi-county clusters that correspond with healthcare-seeking patterns. All publicly-available county-level NSSP data are really HSA values, such that each county in the HSA will have the same value as the parent HSA.\nA list of HSAs can be downloaded here.\nNSSP surveillance data at the HSA level can be downloaded from the CDC."

The following plot shows reporting counties as of Jan. 12, 2025. Recall all counties in an HSA will have the same value as the parent HSA.\nnssp_county &lt;- covidcast::covidcast_signal(\"nssp\", \"pct_ed_visits_influenza\",\n                                geo_type = \"county\",\n                                time_type = \"week\")\nplot(nssp_county, time_value = \"2025-01-12\")\n\nThe following code uses the epidatr package to return county-level data, where geo_value is the FIPS code of the county. Again, the values returned for an individual county are really those of the parent HSA.\nepidatr::pub_covidcast(source = \"nssp\", signals = \"pct_ed_visits_influenza\", geo_type = \"county\", geo_values = \"25015\", time_type = \"week\")"

Building the capacity to forecast at the metro-level may be crucial in times of outbreak planning and response.\nNSSP HSA-level data are publicly available, making it quicker and easier to expand forecasting efforts to additional jurisdictions that report these data.\nA more detailed visual breakdown of HSAs for each state can be found here. This document also provides line plots for each state illustrating the difference between the percentage of ED visits for the state (grey line) vs. each individual HSA in that state (orange line)."
